HONK! Festival West is an independent 501(c)(3) arts organization that produces an annual free, three-day, community-supported music festival in public spaces of the Seattle area. This immersive festival is driven by the energetic performances of street bands from around the world. HONK! is part of a global renaissance of street band culture, with Seattle’s festival occurring since 2008.

In 2021 HONK! Fest West transitioned to a federally recognized501(c)(3) non-profit known as HONK Festival West. We are excited to usher in a new era of programming for our community, while continuing our iconic annual HONK! Fest West in June, including the return of the HONK! All-Stars Band, monthly HONK! Jams, and HONK! Junior.

HONK! is a celebration of community, collaboration and creative expression and is dedicated to creating a community of inclusion. We work to break down systemic barriers to inclusion for those underrepresented within our community, and increase community access to our programming by producing the festival in neighborhoods of the Seattle area underserved by the arts. Our interactive celebrations are designed to be accessible, with representation from a wide range of ages and abilities; offering pick-up bands throughout the festival open for anyone who would like to pick up an instrument and play.

Bands at HONK! Fest West travel from all over the country to temporarily transform streets in various neighborhoods with a free showcase of various musical styles. The bands represent traditions ranging from New Orleans second line brass bands, punk rock marching bands, European Klezmer, Balkan and Romani music, Samba, Maracatu, as well as the passion and spirit of Mardi Gras and Carnival!

We have called Georgetown our home since the festival’s inception, and have also celebrated in Columbia City, White Center, South Park, The Waterfront, Fremont/Gas Works Park, Capitol Hill, Central District, Pioneer Square, Downtown, Seattle Center, and West Seattle.

**Join us! May 30: TBD, May 31: TBD, and June 1: TBD.**

We can’t wait to kick off Summer in Seattle with you in 2025.
