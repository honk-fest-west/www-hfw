We are a completely volunteer-run organization and festival and are currently recruiting to fill some key roles on our various Committees. We have roles both big and small on our **Event Production Committee**, our **Outreach Committee**, our **Creative Communications Committee**, and our **Fundraising Committee**. If you are interested, head over to our Volunteers page to see some specific roles or just send an email to [volunteer@honkfestwest.org](mailto:volunteer@honkfestwest.org) for more information on how you can get involved.
