HONK! Fest West activates public space to make communities stronger and more connected. The raucously engaging performances provide the universal benefits of celebrating music together with no limitations arising from age, race, gender identity, cultural background, ethnic and indigenous identity, native language, immigration status, ability, religion, education, socioeconomic status, or sexual orientation. HONK! Fest West focuses on cooperative values; participatory culture; breaking down barriers to music and art; introduction to different cultural traditions through music; and the key tenet that anyone can be a part of the experience.
