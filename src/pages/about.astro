					HONK! Fest West is an independent 501(c)(3) arts organization that produces a free, three-day, community-supported music festival devoted to marching bands, drum corps, samba lines, and anything acoustic and mobile that makes a ruckus. This immersive festival occurs annually in June, and is 100% volunteer-run, performed, and organized. HONK! is part of a global renaissance of street band culture, with Seattle’s festival occurring since 2008. 

				<br/><br/>

					HONK! happens in the public spaces of the Seattle area. We are found in the streets and parks. We are found under bridges and on rooftops. We are found in parades marching down your street. We have called Georgetown our home since the festival’s inception, and have also celebrated in Columbia City, White Center, South Park, The Waterfront, Fremont/Gas Works Park, Capitol Hill, Central District, Pioneer Square, Downtown, Seattle Center, and West Seattle.

				<br/><br/>

					Most recently, we had a 1-day HONK! celebration in Columbia City in September 2021.  We are looking forward to being back in action in June 2022 for our traditional 3-day extravaganza! Planning has already begun, so stay tuned!

			<Title title="Diversity" subtitle="and Inclusion"/>
			<p class="content">
				HONK! Fest West activates public space to make communities stronger and more connected. The raucously engaging performances provide the universal benefits of celebrating music together with no limitations arising from age, race, gender identity, cultural background, ethnic and indigenous identity, native language, immigration status, ability, religion, education, socioeconomic status, or sexual orientation. HONK! Fest West focuses on cooperative values; participatory culture; breaking down barriers to music and art; introduction to different cultural traditions through music; and the key tenet that anyone can be a part of the experience.
